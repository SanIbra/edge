To add a backend to EDGE :

1) All the informations you need are already given by the descriptor :

Create a .hs file in the Mode folder with a function that will return a list of "ToGenerate" (cf. Generateur.FileGenerator) and take a Stats as parameter (cf. Parseur.TypeStats).

If you have to use a Regex, create the functions you need in Parseur.Regex.


2) You need some information that is not given by the descriptor :

Change the AST structure in the Parseur.DataStructAST file to create nodes for the information you want to stock.

Change the Stats type to stock the information in it (Parseur.TypeStats file).

Implement the functions you need in the Parseur.ParseEdge file to parse the new grammar and the extract function for your information.

Now the information you need can be given by the descriptor.
